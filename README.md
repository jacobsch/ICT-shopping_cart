# shopping-cart

Written and created entirely by Handsworth Students [Owen Holman](https://owenholman.com) and [Jacob Schwartz](https://jacob-schwartz.com)

### ICT-12 Java Programming Semi Final

We were tasked with created an offline shopping cart program similar to Amazon however offline for our teacher using Java.
Owen and Jacob took the same login template and swing panels from pin-validator however they execute new code at the end.

We used the template of our previous project, [pin-validator](https://github.com/jacobsch/ICT-pin_validator) as the login for our shopping cart and then we expanded further by adding new elements to the program

### Running the Program
Open the package.bluej file in BlueJ and compile and then run the main class
